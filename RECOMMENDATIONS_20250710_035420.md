# Improvement Suggestions for DeerFlow

The following suggestions identify potential enhancements across the project and outline ideas to support the ingestion and research workflow described in the user request.

## Core Capabilities
- **LLM Integration**
  - Provide a unified interface to register custom LLM providers.
  - Add a configuration option to dynamically select models per task.
- **Multi-Agent Workflow**
  - Implement better error handling when an agent fails to produce valid output.
  - Add logging for each agent step to aid debugging and tracing.

## Tools and MCP Integrations
- **Search and Retrieval**
  - Support additional search engines (e.g., DuckDuckGo, SerpAPI).
  - Implement caching of search results to reduce repeated queries.
- **Crawling**
  - Add support for sitemap crawling and following pagination.
  - Provide a plugin system for custom extractors to handle various websites.

## Human Collaboration
- **Human-in-the-loop**
  - Provide a UI component that visualizes current plan steps and allows manual reordering.
  - Expose more fine-grained control over plan iterations and step execution.
- **Report Post-Editing**
  - Offer templates for common report types (technical memo, executive summary, etc.).

## Content Creation
- **Podcast and Presentation Generation**
  - Allow custom TTS backends beyond volcengine.
  - Support exporting slides in multiple formats (PDF, PPTX).

## Research Workflow and Ingestion
- **File and Document Ingestion**
  - Introduce an ingestion pipeline capable of parsing HTML, PDF, Word documents, and plain text.
  - Sanitize the ingested data by removing scripts, normalizing whitespace, and converting text to UTF-8 without losing content.
  - Use chunking (e.g., 500-1000 tokens) for long documents to enable efficient vector storage.
- **Vector DB Integration**
  - Add a module to store embeddings in a vector database such as FAISS, Milvus, or PostgreSQL with pgvector.
  - Provide a retrieval interface to fetch relevant chunks based on similarity search.
- **SQL Database**
  - Store metadata about each ingested document (source URL, title, author, ingestion date) in a relational database.
  - Link metadata entries to corresponding vector database IDs for fast lookup.
- **Embeddings DB**
  - Support multiple embedding models and allow re-embedding when models change.
  - Implement scheduled clean-ups to remove outdated or low-quality vectors.

## Multi-Step Research Process
- Automatically parse user queries into plans with tasks such as "gather references," "summarize findings," and "draft report." 
- Combine results from crawled pages and uploaded documents into a single knowledge base for the report generation step.
- Provide progress feedback to the user via the web interface (e.g., progress bars or step status).

## Web Interface
- Add a dashboard to monitor ingestion jobs and research tasks.
- Allow users to select topics and provide seed URLs or upload documents for ingestion.

## Testing & Reliability
- Implement integration tests for the full workflow, including ingestion and report generation.
- Include data validation to ensure sanitized content still reflects the source material.

## Documentation
- Create tutorials showing how to configure vector DB, SQL DB, and embedding models.
- Document best practices for sanitizing and chunking data before storage.
